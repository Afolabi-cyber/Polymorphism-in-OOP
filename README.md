polymorphism explains the ability of a function to exist in different forms or work on different things in the same time

# Polymorphism in Python

This repository demonstrates the concept of **Polymorphism** in Object-Oriented Programming using Python. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, making the code more flexible and reusable.

## What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means "many shapes" and refers to the ability to perform a single action in different forms. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

### Example

We have two classes, `Dog` and `Cat`, each with a `sound()` method. Using polymorphism, we can use the same function `make_sound()` to handle both object types.

## Running the Code

```bash
python polymorphism.py
